  1. As a user, I want to maintain a watching list (favorite) so that I can keep track of the cars that I am interested in.
  2. As a user/buyer, I want to keep an interest list (certain color, brand and price) so that sellers may contact me if they have compatible offers.
  3. As a user/seller, I want to keep an inventory list so that potential buyers may see what I have.
  4. As  a user/buyer, I want to see detailed informations of the car so that I can determine if the price is reasonable or not.
  5. As a user/seller, I want to post the condition of the car (year, make, model, mileage) so that buyers can have better knowledge about the car.

##Project #4 User Stories

  2. As a user, I want to choose to display all or part of my contact information so that I can have a control on how people will reach me.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to post swap/trade request so that I can swap my car with another person.
